# How to run programs
In.java needs to be running for these to work :)


# MMMAnimal Program
Open these programs for it to work:

• In.Java

• MMMTourney.java

• SimpleMMMAnimal or DetailMMMAnimal (use SimpleMMMAnimal if you don't care about how much each attack does. The console gets full quick if you use DetailMMMAnimal)


# Wilsons Palace Casino Program
Open these programs for it to work:

• In.Java

• JEventQueue.Java

(Make sure to download background.PNG for the background to work)
